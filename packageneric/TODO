*	problem reported by magnus:
	after a scons --clean, when trying to build again:
	/tmp/++packageneric/variants/default/intermediate/freepsycle/modules/freepsycle-gui/src/packageneric/module.private.hpp:1:51 error: packageneric/source-package.private.hpp: No such file or directory

microsoft:
	
*	for vcproj, use InheritedPropertySheets pointing to vcprops files.
	-- bohan

configuration headers:
	
*	to allow for static libraries to be built,
	split packageneric/package/modules/*/defines.private.hpp
	into two separate files: meta-informations.private.hpp and sources.private.hpp.
	then source.private.hpp can be included by client sources,
	while still having their own meta-informations.private.hpp.
	Possibly sources.private.hpp could be installed like gtk packages do, in $(libdir)/include
	(new automake var pkglibincludedir = $(pkglib)/include, and use of stanza nobase_pkglibinclude_HEADERS)
	Note that .pc files have Requires.private for static libs, but,
	making the additional -I cflag only active for static build would then require an additional .pc file,
	which would never be invoked directly. Anyway the file has a .private.hpp extension which already denote
	it's not part of the public interface, and it doesn't contain any functions or objects.

*	the generated .pc files have suprious or missing paths and dependencies
	-- bohan

*	headers are not copied to install include dir
	-- bohan
	
*	have a look at new scons features added in the two last google summer of code projects,
	particularly, the automake-like features
	-- bohan

misc:

*	remember to update the TODO file.
	-- bohan

======== done but needs more testing ========
